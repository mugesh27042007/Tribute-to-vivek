            <h2>üéñÔ∏èPadma Shri Vivek</h2>
            <p><b>Vivekanandan</b> (19 November 1961 ‚Äì 17 April 2021), known professionally as <b>Vivek</b>,[2] was an Indian actor, comedian, television personality, playback singer and social activist who worked in the Tamil film industry. He was introduced in films by director K. Balachander in Manathil Urudhi Vendum (1987)

He has won three Filmfare Award for Best Comedian ‚Äì Tamil for Run (2002), Saamy (2003), Perazhagan (2004) and five Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Comedian for the films, Unnaruge Naan Irundhal (1999), Run (2002), Parthiban Kanavu (2003), Anniyan (2005) and Sivaji (2007).

His comedy style consisted of one-liners and wordplay that featured social and political satire, which led to critics comparing him to N. S. Krishnan and earning him the nickname Chinna Kalaivanar.

In 2009, the Government of India awarded Vivek the Padma Shri award for his contribution to the arts.[3] Sathyabama University conferred Vivek with an honorary doctorate for his contribution to society through cinema. As a television personality, Vivek hosted a number of events and interviewed media personalities, notably A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Inspired by Kalam's environmentalism, Vivek founded the Green Kalam initiative in 2010 with the mission of planting one billion trees across Tamil Nadu

            <h5>Green Kalam</h5>
            <p>In 2010, Vivek launched Green Kalam, a project to plant trees across India inspired by former President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.[52] Through Twitter, he mobilized volunteers, particularly from schools and colleges, to join the initiative. Kalam insisted the project should not be named after him, after which Vivek briefly changed its name to Green Globe.[53] As of his death, over 3,300,000 saplings had been planted.</p>
